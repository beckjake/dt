A tool for running dbt unit/integration tests locally.

You must have appropriate profiles / environment variables set up, I forget what those are, sorry!

--help is useful :)

Python version defaults to 3.6
No args defaults to `dt -i --pg

To run postgres integration tests: `dt -i --pg` (this is the default)
To run postgres integration tests, clearing `dbt.log` beforehand: `dt -il --pg`
To run postgres + redshift integration tests: `dt -i --pg --rs`
To run python 2.7 unit tests: `dt -v 27 -u`
To run python 2.7 unit + integration tests, and pep8: `dt -v 27 -iup`
